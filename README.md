Using LLM and LangChain to Summarize Github repository and code comprehension using Gemini and OpenAI API
Below output is generated by the application itself
The provided code demonstrates a detailed workflow that involves several key steps:

1. **Cloning the Repository:**
   - The workflow begins with cloning a GitHub repository using the `cloneGit` utility. This step involves specifying the repository URL and a local directory where the repository will be cloned.



2. **Splitting Code Files:**
   - After cloning the repository, the code files are split into smaller text chunks for further processing. This is done using the `load_split_file` function, which utilizes a text splitter to segment the code files into manageable pieces.

3. **Creating Embeddings:**
   - The split code file chunks are then used to create embeddings. This involves setting up a database for storing these embeddings using the `create_chroma_db` function. Each document (text chunk) is embedded using a specific function (`GeminiEmbeddingFunction`), and these embeddings are stored in the Chroma database.

4. **Setting Up Conversational Retrieval:**
   - The workflow then integrates conversational retrieval capabilities using an LLMChain model from OpenAI and a memory mechanism to handle conversation history. This allows for interactive querying of information related to the code repository.

5. **Key Tools and Insights:**
   - **Tools Used:** The workflow leverages various tools and libraries:
     - Git and GitPython for repository cloning and management.
     - OpenAI for generating conversational responses.
     - Chroma for storing and retrieving embeddings.
     - Pandas for data manipulation.
     - Google GenerativeAI for conversational AI capabilities.
   - **Interactive Querying:** The workflow enables users to ask questions about the code repository interactively. These queries are processed using the conversational retrieval chain, providing answers based on the context of the code files and previous conversations.
   - **Automation and Integration:** The workflow seamlessly combines repository cloning, text processing, embedding creation, and conversational retrieval into an automated process. This integration allows for efficient extraction of information from code repositories through natural language queries.

Overall, the workflow showcases a sophisticated pipeline for exploring code repositories, extracting insights, and engaging in interactive conversations to retrieve relevant information. By combining the capabilities of different tools and technologies, users can efficiently navigate codebases and extract valuable knowledge through conversational interactions.
